# sga-weekly-movies
An archive of the SGA weekly movies

## What?
This repository maintains a list of the movies shown by the Student Government Association at St. Olaf College, who choose a new movie to show on campus each week.

We began tracking these movies in the fall of the 2017-18 school year.

## Usage
If you want to do things with the raw data, you're free to use `master`.

However, we process the data to do things like extract the dominant color of the movie poster; those processed files are stored on the `gh-pages` branch.

If you're wanting to use the processed data files, here's what you need to know:

- There are two top-level files, `archive.json` and `next.json`. They are more-or-less just pointers to the actual data files.
- Each movie has an `index.json` file that actually contains the data

These `index.json` files look like this:

```json

A few things to note:

- Inside the `posters` object, you get a selection of poster sizes, as well as a mapping of the poster colors
- Similarly, each trailer comes with a selection of thumbnails and the dominant colors of that trailer

## Contibuting
To add a new movie:

1. Get an OMDB API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
2. Take the key they email you, and export it: `export OMDB_API_KEY="my-key"`
    - I recommend putting this in your shell's config file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, etc)
3. Install Pipenv, if you don't have it already: https://docs.pipenv.org
4. Install our dependencies: `pipenv install`
5. Download the movie info: `./bin/add-movie YYYY-MM-DD MovieName`
    - `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date that the movie will be shown
    - `MovieName` is the name of the movie
    - The script will ask you to pick the correct movie
6. Make sure the "showings" are correct (in `showings.json`) â€“ sometimes SGA shows movies on odd days/times
7. Commit and PR!

If you need to check that your files are workable, you can run

```bash
pipenv run python bin/build.py
```
