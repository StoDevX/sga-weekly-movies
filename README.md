# sga-weekly-movies
An archive of the SGA weekly movies

My goal is (as automatically as possible, ofc) to input a movie title/year, the days and times of the showing, and fetch both the info json _and_ to download the poster into the repo, so that we don't abuse the image hosts.

For now, I'm adding these manually – I'll eventually subscribe to <http://www.omdbapi.com> for the automation / because I feel guilty manually scraping them.
